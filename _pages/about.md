I am a CFD Engineer with a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from Cranfield University. With over 10 years of experience, I specialize in delivering energy-efficient solutions through advanced computational fluid dynamics modeling.

My expertise includes:

- **Data Center Thermal Optimization** - Designing efficient cooling strategies for high-performance computing environments
- **HVAC Systems Analysis** - Optimizing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems for improved energy efficiency
- **Multiphysics Simulations** - Coupled thermal-fluid-structural analysis for complex engineering problems
- **Rotor Aerodynamics** - Advanced analysis of rotary wing systems and turbomachinery

I work with industry-leading CFD tools including OpenFOAM and ANSYS CFX to solve challenging fluid dynamics problems and deliver innovative solutions for thermal management and aerodynamic optimization.

I am open to CFD consulting projects and research collaborations in thermal optimization, HVAC systems, and multiphysics simulations.
